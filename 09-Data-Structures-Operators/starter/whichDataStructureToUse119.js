//// simple list of values -> an array or a set
//// key value pairs       -> an object or a map
//// ARRAYS ğŸ‘‰use when you need ordered list of values(might contain dublicates) ğŸ‘‰ ...manipulate data
//// SETS ğŸ‘‰use when you need to work with unique values ğŸ‘‰ ...high performance really important ğŸ‘‰ ...remove duplicates from arrays
//-----------------------------------------------------------//
//// OBJECTS ğŸ‘‰ more traditional key/value store ğŸ‘‰easier to write and access values with . and [] ğŸ‘‰ ..when you need to include functions (methods) ğŸ‘‰working with JSON (can convert to map)
//// MAPS ğŸ‘‰better performance ğŸ‘‰keys can have any data type ğŸ‘‰easy to iterate ğŸ‘‰easy to compute size  ğŸ‘‰need to map key to values ğŸ‘‰ need keys that are not strings
