// destructuring
const [players1, players2] = game.players;
console.log(`Players1 team ‚öΩ ${players1}`);
console.log(`Players2 team ‚öΩ ${players2}`);

// 2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players //

const gk1 = players1[0];

for (const [i, allPlayers] of game.players.entries()) {
  console.log(`${i + 1}: ${allPlayers}`);

// 4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic' //

// 7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.

//////////// Coding Challenge #2 ///////////////////
// 1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
///// with destructuring /////////
// üëâüëÄ in the array we use the entries method to get the entries of the array
for (const [i, player] of game.scored.entries()) {
  console.log(`Goal ${i + 1}: ${player}`);
}
/* output 
Goal 1: Lewandowski
Goal 2: Gnarby
Goal 3: Lewandowski
Goal 4: Hummels */

// 2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We already studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember)
// 1.variant //////////////////
// getting values of object
const values = Object.values(game.odds);
console.log(values);
// output ¬†[1.33, 3.25, 6.5]

// now simply loop over the array to get value
values.forEach((value) => {

// output 1.33 3.25 6.5

average /= odds.length;
console.log(average);

// 3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33 Odd of draw: 3.25 Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5 Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the same property names.
const printOdds = Object.values(game.odds);
console.log(printOdds);
console.log(`Odd of victory ${game.team1}: ${game.odds.team1}`);
console.log(`Odd of victory ${game.team2}: ${game.odds.team2}`);
console.log(`Odd of draw: ${game.odds.x}`);

// üëâüëÄ in the object we have to use the object.entries and then pass into the functions
for (const [team, odd] of Object.entries(game.odds)) {
  const teamStr = team === "x" ? "draw" : `victory ${game[team]}`;
  console.log(`Odd of ${teamStr} ${odd}`);
}

// 4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value. In this game, it will look like this:
// {
//  Gnarby: 1,
//  Hummels: 1,
//  Lewandowski: 2
// }
const scorers = {};
for (const player of game.scored) {
  scorers[player] ? scorers[player]++ : (scorers[player] = 1);
}
console.log(scorers);
// output {Lewandowski: 2, Gnarby: 1, Hummels: 1}
// Gnarby: 1,
// Hummels: 1,
// Lewandowski: 2
